My animation shows  a war zone scenario in which a US Air Force helicopter is hovering around a castle.\
The helicopter was built by combining different shapes together and applying a military camouflage texture with national flag on it.\
My custom shape is a pyramid which was made from scratch with triangles. The objects using this custom shape are the roofs of the 4 towers located at the 4 corners of the castle (textured with orange bricks).\
\
This animation has 4 different stages of the camera perspective:\
Stage 1: Static view\
Stage 2: Tracking the helicopter from its left side\
Stage 3: Tracking the helicopter from a different angle\
Stage 4: Tracking the helicopter from the right side (The viewer sits at the top center of the castle).}
