Write a program that displays an animated scene. Your scene should include a combination of hierarchical objects that move around. Required elements:
[4 points] Show at least one two-level hierarchical object (e.g., a human arm)
[4 points]  Demonstrate the camera tracking a moving object using lookAt().
[6 points]  Design polygonal objects of your own. You must provide positions, normals, and texture coordinates directly, by extending the Shape class.
[2 points] For one of your custom polygonal objects, show at least one flat-shaded seam (a discontinuous edge) and light it with the Phong reflection model.
[2 points] Texture one of your custom polygonal objects procedurally or by mapping an image.
[2 points] Real-time speed. Make sure that your animation runs at the same speed regardless of the machine your program runs on; i.e., one simulated second corresponds roughly to one real second.
[2 points] Display the frame rate of your program on the graphics window.
[2 points] Make and submit a movie of your animation (length 90 sec or less) using your favorite screen recording application (e.g., camstudio/quicktime).  If your program is interactive, submit a video of it being used. You can add subtitles. Make sure you encode your movie to within 100MB and observe the 90s limit.
[4 points] Creativity (story, aesthetic style, etc).
[4 points] Complexity.  Are the underlying mechanics that make it work impressive?
[5 points] Overall quality: Fluidity of object and camera motion, attention to detail in scene construction and texturing, etc.
